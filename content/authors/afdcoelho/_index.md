I am a Bioinformatics and Computational Biology Master's student currently developing my thesis at RNA Systems Biology Lab (BioISI). 
During my Biochemistry Bachelor, I fell in love with Bioinformatics and since then I have been looking to improve my computational skills. My first internship and first year at my masters allowed me to extensively increase my knowledge and made me passionate about machine learning. 
With my master's thesis, I hope to further increase my knowledge in topics such as systems biology and machine learning.
