abstract: Germinal centers (GCs) are anatomic structures where B cells undergo affinity
  maturation, leading to production of high-affinity antibodies. The balance between
  T follicular helper (TFH) and regulatory (TFR) cells is critical for adequate control
  of GC responses. The study of human TFH and TFR cell development has been hampered
  because of the lack of in vitro assays reproducing in vivo biology, along with difficult
  access to healthy human lymphoid tissues. We used a single-cell transcriptomics
  approach to study the maturation of TFH and TFR cells isolated from human blood,
  iliac lymph nodes (LNs), and tonsils. As independent tissues have distinct proportions
  of follicular T cells in different maturation states, we leveraged the heterogeneity
  to reconstruct the maturation trajectory for human TFH and TFR cells. We found that
  the dominant maturation of TFR cells follows a bifurcated trajectory from precursor
  Treg cells, with one arm of the bifurcation leading to blood TFR cells and the other
  leading to the most mature GC TFR cells. Overall, our data provide a comprehensive
  resource for the transcriptomics of different follicular T cell populations and
  their dynamic relationship across different tissues.
